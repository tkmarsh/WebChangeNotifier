# WebChangeNotifier
Bash script that checks the MD5 hash of a webpage to check for changes and sends a push notification to smartphones using pushover when it changes.

Use cron to run the script and set the interval it checks at.


Made this waiting for some artist to reopen comissions, don't want to miss a spot.
